export const HERO_CONTENT = `I am a passionate front-end developer with a knack for building robust and scalable web applications. With my modest experience gained over the past 2 years, I have honed my skills in front-end technologies like React and Next.js, as well as advanced technologies like three.js and React fiber. I also have some experience in back-end and am proficient in dealing with databases and some technologies like php, sql, mysql, laravel but I preferred to focus on front-end because I am a creative person and my goal is to leverage my expertise to create seamless, innovative and 3D interfaces that drive business growth, engage users and deliver exceptional user experiences.`;
